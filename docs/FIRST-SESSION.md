# Your First Session

A 15-minute guided walkthrough. By the end, you'll have used your assistant to analyze a document and draft a memo.

**Before you start:** Make sure you've followed the [Quick Start Guide](QUICKSTART.md) and have your workspace running in VS Code.

---

## Step 1: Put a Document in Your Folder (2 minutes)

Find a document you want to work with — a contract, a report, a policy memo, anything relevant to your practice.

1. Open File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac)
2. Go to `Documents > ClientWork`
3. Copy your document into this folder

Your assistant can see it now. PDFs, Word docs, and text files all work.

---

## Step 2: Review the Document (5 minutes)

In your VS Code terminal where Claude is running, ask it to review your document. Just describe what you want in plain language:

> "Review the contract I just added to my folder"

or

> "Read through the Smith proposal and give me your analysis"

Your assistant will read the document and produce a structured analysis:
- **Overview** — what the document is and who wrote it
- **Summary** — the key points in a few sentences
- **Issues** — anything unclear, missing, or concerning
- **Recommendations** — what you should do next

The review is saved as a new file in your ClientWork folder.

---

## Step 3: Read the Review (2 minutes)

You can read the review two ways:

**In Claude:** Ask follow-up questions:
- "What were the main issues you found?"
- "Tell me more about your first recommendation"

**On your desktop:** Open File Explorer, go to `Documents > ClientWork`, and open the review file. It's a Markdown file — readable in any text editor.

---

## Step 4: Draft a Memo (5 minutes)

Ask your assistant to draft something based on what it found:

> "Draft a memo to my client summarizing the top three issues from the review, with recommended next steps"

Your assistant will:
1. Ask clarifying questions (who's the audience? what tone?)
2. Show you an outline
3. Ask if it looks right
4. Write the full memo after you approve
5. Save it in your ClientWork folder

---

## Step 5: Find Your Files (1 minute)

Open `Documents > ClientWork` on your desktop. You should see:

1. **Your original document** — untouched
2. **The review** — your assistant's analysis
3. **The memo** — your new draft

These are regular files. Email them, open them in Word, edit them, print them.

---

## What You Just Did

In 15 minutes, you:
- Had an AI assistant analyze a document
- Got a structured review with issues and recommendations
- Drafted a client memo based on those findings
- Produced real files sitting in your folder

This is one of two core workflows: **read, analyze, draft**. The other is **describe, build, use** — ask Claude to build tools for your practice (see below).

---

## What to Try Next

**Ask your assistant anything about your documents:**
- "Summarize this report in two pages"
- "What are the key differences between these two contracts?"
- "Help me prepare interview questions based on these audit findings"
- "Rewrite the executive summary to be more persuasive"

**Have it build tools for your practice:**
- "Create a tracker spreadsheet for these compliance items"
- "Build a comparison dashboard for these two budgets"
- "Make a timeline visualization of these project milestones"

**Tips:**
- Be specific: "Draft a 2-page memo" beats "write something"
- Name the audience: writing for a judge differs from writing for a project manager
- Ask for revisions: "Make it more formal" or "Add a section about risk"

## Getting Help

1. Describe your problem to Claude — it's trained to help troubleshoot
2. Check [troubleshooting](QUICKSTART.md#troubleshooting) in the Quick Start Guide
3. If Claude can't resolve it, ask it to summarize the issue — then send that summary to your support person
