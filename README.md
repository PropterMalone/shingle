# Shingle

**Claude Code starter kit for solo consultants.**

Shingle gives solo consultants (attorneys, auditors, policy analysts, GovCon advisors) a ready-to-use Claude Code environment — no terminal experience required. Describe what you need, and Claude builds it: documents, trackers, dashboards, comparison tools, data analyses.

## What You Get

- **Isolated workspace** — A devcontainer with your documents mounted and a network firewall that only allows essential traffic
- **Domain-tuned assistant** — CLAUDE.md templates that make Claude speak your language (legal, audit, policy, or GovCon)
- **Tool-building environment** — TypeScript, Vite, Python, pandoc, and chart.js pre-installed so Claude can build tools for your practice
- **Professional plugins** — Planning, code quality, research, and multi-agent workflows via ed3d plugins
