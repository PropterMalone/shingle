# Shingle

**Claude Code starter kit for solo consultants.**

Shingle gives ex-federal consultants (attorneys, auditors, policy analysts, GovCon advisors) a ready-to-use Claude Code environment with practice-specific skills — no terminal experience required.

## What You Get

- **Isolated workspace** — A devcontainer that drops you into Claude Code with your documents mounted and a network firewall that only allows Anthropic API traffic
- **Practice-area skills** — `/review`, `/summarize`, `/draft`, and `/help-me` commands tailored to your work
- **Domain-tuned assistant** — CLAUDE.md templates that make Claude speak your language (legal, audit, policy, or GovCon)

## Quick Start
